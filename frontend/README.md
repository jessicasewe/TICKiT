**4. Challenge**
**Problem Statement:**
The TICKiT event web service seeks to tackle the challenge of streamlining and simplifying the process of ticket procurement for a diverse range of events, including conferences, sports, and entertainment. The current landscape often involves fragmented ticketing platforms, making it challenging for users to discover, purchase, and manage tickets seamlessly.
Limitations - What the Project Will Not Solve:
While TICKiT addresses the ticketing process, it does not solve broader issues related to event planning, logistics, or external factors affecting event attendance. It focuses specifically on providing a user-friendly platform for ticket transactions but does not guarantee event success, handle event organization, or address external circumstances affecting event attendance.
Target Audience and Users
TICKiT is designed to assist event enthusiasts, sports fans, conference attendees, and anyone looking for a convenient and centralized platform to purchase tickets for various events. It caters to a broad user base, including individuals seeking event tickets for personal enjoyment or professional networking.
Relevance to Locale:
TICKiT is not inherently dependent on a specific locale. While it can benefit users globally, the events listed on the platform may be localized based on geographical preferences. The service's adaptability allows it to be relevant and accessible to users worldwide, providing a universal solution for event ticketing needs


**5. Risks**

**Non-Technical Risks:**

**Potential Impact:** Market Competition


**Description:** Increased competition or market shifts could impact the service's user base and revenue.
Strategies for Prevention: Regular market analysis, staying updated on industry trends, and fostering customer loyalty through exclusive offers or partnerships will be pursued. The service will also strive for continuous improvement based on user feedback

**Potential Impact:** Legal and Compliance Issues
Description: Non-compliance with data protection regulations, licensing issues, or legal disputes could have severe consequences.
Strategies for Prevention: Regular legal assessments, compliance checks, and ensuring adherence to relevant laws and regulations will be prioritized. Legal consultation will be sought to address any potential concerns proactively


**Technical Risks:**
 
** Potential Impact**: System Downtime or Performance Issues Description: Technical glitches, server outages, or unexpected issues in third-party integrations could lead to service downtime or suboptimal performance. 
Safeguards/Alternatives: Regular system monitoring, automated testing, and redundant server configurations will be implemented to minimize downtime. A robust backup system and contingency plans for quick issue resolution will be in place.

**Potential Impact:** Security Vulnerabilities

**Description:** Potential breaches or vulnerabilities in the system could compromise user data and erode trust.
Safeguards/Alternatives: Regular security audits, encryption protocols, and strict access controls will be implemented. Continuous monitoring for potential threats, prompt software updates, and a response plan for security incidents will be integral.

**6. Infrastructure**

**Branching and Merging:**

**Process:** The team follows the Gitflow branching model. The main branches include master for production-ready code, develop for ongoing development, and feature branches for specific features or bug fixes. Feature branches are created, developed, and tested locally before merging into the develop branch. Release branches are used for final testing and preparing for production, and hotfix branches address urgent issues in the master branch.

**Deployment Strategy:**

**Strategy:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is employed. Changes pushed to the develop branch trigger automated tests. Successful tests prompt deployment to a staging environment for further testing. Once approved, changes are merged into the master branch, triggering automatic deployment to the production environment. Rollback strategies are in place to address unforeseen issues.
Data Population:

**Approach:** The app's initial data is populated through seed scripts or fixtures during the deployment process. For ongoing updates, data may be sourced from APIs, user input, or integrated external systems. Regular database backups and versioning are implemented to ensure data integrity and provide recovery options.

**Testing Tools and Automation:**

**Tools:** Testing is conducted using a combination of unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.

**Automation:** Automated testing tools such as pytest for unit tests and Selenium for end-to-end tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Additionally, linting tools like ESLint for JavaScript and Pylint for Python are used to enforce code quality standards. Continuous monitoring tools are in place to identify potential issues in real-time.
